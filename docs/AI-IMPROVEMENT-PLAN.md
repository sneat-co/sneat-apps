## 🎯 TOP 10 TASKS (Priority Order)

### TIER 1: Critical - High Impact, Low Effort ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

#### ~~Task 1: Re-enable Unit Tests in CI/CD Pipeline~~ ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Unit tests re-enabled in CI pipeline

**Impact**: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 | **Effort**: 🟢 Low (2 hours) | **ROI**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem** (Resolved):

- Unit tests were **commented out** in `.github/workflows/build-nx.yml` (lines 61-62)
- Only Playwright E2E tests ran in CI, leaving unit test failures undetected
- Regressions could reach production

**Solution Implemented**:

```yaml
# In .github/workflows/build-nx.yml (lines 61-62)
- name: nx test affected
  run: pnpm run nx affected --target=test --base=${{ env.NX_BASE }} --parallel=8
```

**Completed Steps**:

1. ✅ Re-enabled test step in workflow using `nx affected`
2. ✅ Configured to run only affected tests (efficient)
3. ✅ Tests run in parallel (8 workers) for faster execution
4. ✅ Verified YAML syntax and test execution locally

**Actual Results**:

- ✅ All PRs now run unit tests automatically
- ✅ Test failures will block merges
- ✅ Only affected tests run (efficient CI)
- ✅ Parallel execution for faster CI runs

#### Task 5: Split Large Components (Code Smell) ❌ NOT COMPLETED

**Status**: PENDING - Large components still exist and need refactoring

**Impact**: 🔥🔥🔥 | **Effort**: 🟡 Medium (6-8 hours) | **ROI**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem**:
Multiple components exceed 500 lines, violating Single Responsibility Principle:

- `libs/datatug/main/src/lib/queries/query/sql-query/sql-query-editor.component.ts` (775 lines)
- `libs/scrumspace/dailyscrum/src/lib/scrum-page/scrum-page.component.ts` (661 lines)
- `libs/extensions/listus/src/lib/pages/list/list-page.component.ts` (607 lines)
- `libs/extensions/schedulus/shared/src/lib/components/happening-slot-form/happening-slot-form.component.ts` (652 lines)
- `libs/datatug/main/src/lib/queries/query/page/query-page.component.ts` (594 lines)

**Solution**:
Extract sub-components and services:

```typescript
// Before: sql-query-editor.component.ts (775 lines)
@Component({ ... })
export class SqlQueryEditorComponent {
  // SQL editor logic
  // Query execution logic
  // Results display logic
  // Error handling
}

// After: Split into 3 components + 1 service
// sql-query-editor.component.ts (200 lines) - orchestrator
// sql-editor-input.component.ts (150 lines) - editor UI
// sql-query-results.component.ts (200 lines) - results display
// sql-query.service.ts (150 lines) - business logic
```

**Steps**:

1. Identify logical boundaries in large components
2. Extract UI sub-components
3. Extract business logic to services
4. Create tests for each new unit
5. Verify functionality unchanged

**Target**: Max 200-250 lines per component

**Success Metrics**:

- ✅ No components >400 lines
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to test individual pieces

- Aliases are actively used throughout the codebase
- No deep relative imports (`../../../../`) found in recent code

**Actual Results**:

- ✅ Clean imports using @sneat/\* patterns
- ✅ Easier refactoring and code navigation
- ✅ Clear module boundaries

---

#### ~~Task 8: Add Pre-commit Test Coverage Hooks~~ ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Pre-commit hook runs tests for affected projects

**Implementation Details**:
Pre-commit hook at `.git-hooks/pre-commit` includes:

- Circular dependency checks with madge
- Automated test execution for changed TypeScript files
- Uses `pnpm nx affected --target=test` to run only affected tests
- Blocks commit if tests fail
- Provides helpful error messages
- Allows bypass with `--no-verify` flag

**Code** (lines 15-26 of .git-hooks/pre-commit):

```bash
if [ -n "$CHANGED_FILES" ]; then
  echo "TypeScript files changed, running tests for affected projects..."
  pnpm nx affected --target=test --base=HEAD 2>/dev/null || pnpm nx affected --target=test --base=main

  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Tests failed. Fix tests before committing."
    echo "💡 Tip: Use 'git commit --no-verify' to skip this check if needed."
    exit 1
  fi
  echo "✅ All tests passed!"
fi
```

**Actual Results**:

- ✅ Tests run automatically before commit
- ✅ Broken tests blocked at source
- ✅ Faster feedback loop for developers
