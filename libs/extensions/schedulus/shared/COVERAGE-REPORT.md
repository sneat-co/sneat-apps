- Test `schedule-calculator.service.ts` with mocked dependencies
- Test `schedule-export.service.ts` and `schedule-import.service.ts`
- Target: 70%+ coverage on services

### Phase 3: Complex Logic
- Test `recurring-schedule.service.ts` with comprehensive date scenarios
- Focus on edge cases and error handling
- Target: 60%+ coverage
